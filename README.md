# ucsb-cs-try1

This is my first attempt at factoring out a remote theme for supporting UCSB CS course repos.

This first attempt only tries to factor out things into a better way of supporting the same functionality that already exists.

Here's the plan

| Stage | Goal | Repo |
| 1     | Move to remote theme for course instance repos | ucsb-cs-try1 |
| 2     | Move to remote theme for course heading repos | ucsb-cs-try2 |
| 3     | Try to marry those together into one remote theme |    |
| 4     | Try to move to structure with individual quarters under same github org |
| 5     | Try to move to remote storage to select which quarter |
| 6     | Try to move to navigation with Bootstrap instead of Jquery mobile |
